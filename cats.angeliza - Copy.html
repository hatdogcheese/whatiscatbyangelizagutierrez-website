    <h1>WELCOME CATS</h1>
    <p>This website is all about cats.Hope you like it</p>
<p>The cat ( Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. 
    It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often
    referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
    A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; 
    the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.</p>
<h2>Origin and history of cats</h2>
<p>The “cat pattern,” established very early in the evolution of modern mammals,
     was a successful one: early cats were already typical in form at a time when 
     the ancestors of most other modern mammalian types were scarcely recognizable.
      They first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), 
    and they have continued with remarkably little change into modern times.</p>
<h3>Domestication</h3>
<p>Although the origin of the domesticated cat is hidden in antiquity, studies 
involving mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) suggest that there have been two lineages of 
    Felis catus. One lineage (F. silvestris silvestris) appeared in Asia Minor possibly
    as early as 6,400 years ago and dispersed northward and westward into Europe. 
    The other lineage appeared in Egypt sometime between 6,400 and 1,000 years ago
    before spreading throughout the Mediterranean (possibly through human introduction) 
    along paths that paralleled the region’s trade routes. 
    Cats of both lineages continued to breed with the 
    African wildcat (F. silvestris lybica) during their respective dispersals.</p>
<h4>Special traits</h4>
<p>The cat has a subtle repertoire of facial expressions, vocal sounds, 
    and tail and body postures that express its emotional state and intentions. 
    These various signals serve to increase, decrease, or maintain social distance.
    One distinctive social behaviour involves rubbing the side of the head, lips,
    chin, or tail against the owner and against furniture. These regions of the cat’s
    body contain scent glands that seem to play a role
    in establishing a familiar odour in the cat’s environment.</p>

<h5>Behavioral problems</h5>
<body>
    <p>Under conditions of domestication, the cat is subject to a variety of factors that 
     result in behaviour indicative of emotional distress and difficulty in adapting to
     the home environment. Some behaviours are not abnormal but are difficult for owners 
     to accept.The most common behaviour problem in companion cats is that they sometimes 
     urinate and defecate outside the litter box in the house. Organic causes include feline
     urologic syndrome (urinary bladder inflammation and calculi, or stones, in the urinary tract),
     blocked or impacted anal glands, and constipation. Emotional causes include the addition of a
     new family member—another cat, a child, or a spouse. Such changes may make the cat feel
     insecure, so that it deposits urine and feces around the house, possibly as territorial
     marks for security. Cats are creatures of habit, and any change in the family structure
     or in daily routines—resulting, 
     for example, from a move or even from rearranging furniture—can be stressful.</p>
